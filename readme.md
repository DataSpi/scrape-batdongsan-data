# Overview

This project is a data pipeline for scraping real estate listings from [batdongsan.com.vn](https://batdongsan.com.vn). It automates the process of collecting, cleaning, and storing property data such as title, price, area, location, images, and agent information. The scraped data is processed using Python, structured into a pandas DataFrame, and then exported to both Excel and a Supabase database for further analysis or integration. The project is designed to help users monitor the real estate market, analyze trends, and build datasets for machine learning or statistical analysis.
